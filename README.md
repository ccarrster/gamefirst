# gamefirst

I am challening myself to make my own version of every game from Blue Orange Games.

I have made some online versions of table games in the past Photosynthisis, Bang, Video Poker and some ruleless game interfaces like Chess, Checkers, deck of cards and Corsairs.

I own Gobblet and Battle Sheep.

My plan is to make the games one at a time and release them when they are working.

I will work on the rules of the game first.

I will use test driven design.

I plan to provide one API to access all the games.

I will make it rest based, so no game will ever time out. The game state will be stored on the servers file system.

I will make my own web interfaces and AI, but I want to open it up for others to do the same.

I am in no way affiliated with Blue Orange Games.

I am not copying and rule text or artwork.

I will not be calling the games by the same names.

First on the list is Armadora AKA Nuggets
